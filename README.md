This game is a Python terminal game, build during a Diploma in Software Development at Code Institute. Its the third porfolio project out of five and is build in Python.
The game runs in Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku.

The goal of the game is to sink all the computer's battleships before the computer has sunk yours. Best of luck!
